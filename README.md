# Posterity_PythonCV

This is the python code we used to detect the coordinates we want the mannequins to rotate to. I used the library from https://github.com/Ascend-Research/HeadPoseEstimation-WHENet and edited it to generate the coordinates. I also used this to test coordinates on a live video stream (camera).
